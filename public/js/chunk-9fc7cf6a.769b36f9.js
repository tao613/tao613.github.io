is not only a necessary impetus in an artist\'s practice but also an emphatic channel to connect with the viewers. Zhou Li’s recent works distill the feelings and emotions precipitated from individual perceptions into the broader social and historical processes and translating what she’s drawn from the fast-changing events of the present into tangible and resounding forms through her artistic expressions.\n\nThis solo project, "Tracing Peach Blossom Spring" at the Pingshan Art Museum, adopts Tao Yuanming\'s The Peach Blossom Spring from the Eastern Jin Dynasty as a fulcrum to "trace" emotional experiences in the course of history with a "visionary" concept. "Tracing," in the exhibition title, a verb used in its active tense, differentiates Zhou Li\'s artworks from representations of Tao Yuanming\'s narrative. Meanwhile, the term alludes to how reality and the ideal realm connect through the footsteps of the Wuling fisherman despite the story\'s inconsequential outcome. The artist uses this "untraceable" outcome as an analogy for the unique and non-replicable nature of our emotional journey, which resonates with the notion of “traces of emotions," often emphasized in her works.\n \nZhou Li designates the color pink as the base tone for this series of works that bring together "personal experience and ideal realm." Nurtured by traditional Chinese art from a young age and her lasting habit of practicing calligraphy, the artist applies the monochromatic variations known as "the five shades of ink" to feature "multiple applications of a singular tonality" in her works on canvas. Were we to revisit Western art history, we would notice that the color pink, intended to soothe pain and bring hope in many classic artworks, coincides with Zhou Li\'s reason for adopting the same color for the Peach Blossom Spring series, which was initially conceived to convey her grief of losing a family member and the experience of bringing a new life to the world. \n\nIn the past, Zhou Li conceived her self-portrait to look at the world with one eye open and the other shut, which embodied a simultaneous perspective of introspection and outward view.

The exhibition is based on the works of three artists, namely Jiang Jie, Peng Wei and Yin Xiuzhen, with the architect Xu Tiantian creating the space and graphic designer Xiao Mage in charge of posters and other visual systems.\n\nPajamas, mirrors, xanthium and fish nets are the images in Jiang Jie’s works. The high-hanging clothes, the reflection in the mirrors, as well as the layered screens are pushing these images into the space to form a similar scene. Compared with the ordinary hotel room normally with two pajamas, the extra piece hanged in the exhibition hall is going to stand out easily. In the world of “Scenes”, even the slightest difference can inspire a myriad of imaginations. Peng Wei’s works come from different periods of her creation, presenting sceneries and buildings on the body, the emotional life in the shoes, as well as the overlapping stories in the tower. The originally independent objects are stringed together with the clue of “female”. “The One in My Dreams” seems to provide another answer. Su Xiaoxiao meets a Russian poetess who lived in a completely different era, but finds that they two share an inexplicably similar scene. The perception of dreams weaves the story of desire. At the entrance of the exhibition, Yin Xiuzhen uses cement to freeze the flowing past that can no longer be reproduced.

The exhibition is based on the works of three artists, namely Jiang Jie, Peng Wei and Yin Xiuzhen, with the architect Xu Tiantian creating the space and graphic designer Xiao Mage in charge of posters and other visual systems.\n\nPajamas, mirrors, xanthium and fish nets are the images in Jiang Jie’s works. The high-hanging clothes, the reflection in the mirrors, as well as the layered screens are pushing these images into the space to form a similar scene. Compared with the ordinary hotel room normally with two pajamas, the extra piece hanged in the exhibition hall is going to stand out easily. In the world of “Scenes”, even the slightest difference can inspire a myriad of imaginations. Peng Wei’s works come from different periods of her creation, presenting sceneries and buildings on the body, the emotional life in the shoes, as well as the overlapping stories in the tower. The originally independent objects are stringed together with the clue of “female”. “The One in My Dreams” seems to provide another answer. Su Xiaoxiao meets a Russian poetess who lived in a completely different era, but finds that they two share an inexplicably similar scene. The perception of dreams weaves the story of desire.

The exhibition is based on a series of portraits drawn by Xie Nanxing, with the architect He Jianxiang creating the space and the graphic designer Ma Shirui in charge of posters and other visual systems.\n \nXie Nanxing’s way of expression is completely different from traditional “portraits” as he reflects one’s emotions, morality or mental states with their social identity or personal experience rather than their appearance or look. He transforms the “portrait” and reduces it to a business card or some kind of generalized texts, such as some keywords, a story told or a peculiar anecdote related to the subject. Sometimes he will also design a cartoon image to mirror a certain figure in the fairy tale. As a result, his portraits become masks staying unrevealed, as well as shadow waiting to be interpreted.

However, there’s no essence or reality behind the masks, neither is there any answers to the mystery behind those ghosting images. The way art provides for observing, recording and understanding the world has never been determined.\n \nArchitect He Jianxiang starts from the reconstruction of traditional buildings to design the space for the exhibition. Just like portraits, castles are another symbol for eternity in the Western ideology. Firm and solid, they take root in the ground with the interior meticulously hidden behind the monolithic walls, so that we are impressed more often by the exterior look of the grand architecture. In the brand-new “Castel Transparent”, the interior becomes visible with the originally hard exterior wrapped and suspended by soft materials. The “inner castle” is serving as an intricate cross-shaped passage for visitors to travel through. The exhibition hall is therefore divided into four split rooms with different entrances and exits, surrounded by a square winding corridor. It is difficult for viewers to distinguish the interior from the exterior, as if they are traveling through and gazing out over the “castle”, while also looking around at it from a distance at the same time.\n \nThe line between representation and reality is also blurred in the poster created by the designer Ma Shirui, with an unfocused, dull and boring picture, containing simple presentation of information. His way of expression has no symbols or metaphors. It’s realistic but abstract, finite but all involved, close to the essence, but only serves as a representation.\n \nAgainst the craze for photo sharing on social media, the creations of the aforementioned three artists are neither “good-looking”, nor popular, but rather appear to be “obscure”. The mysterious and ambiguous “Mask and Shadow” makes the interpretation of art, architecture, and design no longer self-explanatory or self-evident. It forms a theater full of contemplation, doubts, and hallucinating charm. People need to observe, think, and question for a long time before accessing a more complex space and thoughts implicitly offered by the exhibition. Sometimes you’ll get nothing on the spot though, the puzzle of the “castle” may finally unfold in an eureka moment after a few days.\n \nIt reminds me of “The Castle”, a novel written by Franz Kafka where the protagonist K inadvertently opened a new dimension of narrative after failing to enter the castle close at hand.

The exhibition is based on the geometric installations created by the artist Liu Wei, with the architect Ma Yansong designing the space, and the graphic designer Guang Yu in charge of posters and other visual designs.\n\nAs the backbone of the new generation of cultural representatives, the works of Liu Wei, Ma Yansong, and Guang Yu are rooted in an important stage of China’s development and has been deeply affected by unique changes and vicissitudes of the Chinese society in the new century, that is, the rapid changes of the urban and cultural landscape. In this period, the form in ancient modernism no longer exists as a form. Instead, it has become a medium of rapid change and future imagination. “Fantasia” calls people to follow the guidance of “form”, to pursue the infinite association and “wholism”. The “wholism” here may be the law of motion of everything, while the “light and shadow” may represent the origin of time or its change. The “rising line” will herald the ambition of soaring,  while the “circle” is the starting point and the next loop.\n\nCompared with other projects of “Nine-Tiered Pagoda”, this exhibition presents a new way of cooperation. Artist Liu Wei doesn’t provide a “complete” work, but some materials and scattered parts instead. The circles, blocks, and curves of these geometric shapes, with traces of polish, are like the brushstrokes of a Cubist painting, or the abstract shapes waiting to be placed. The way they will finally be exhibited depends on the architect.\n\nArchitect Ma Yansong places these “unnamed” works in a “unfamiliar” space, similar to a black hole in the universe. This grants the works a completely different temperament, if look and feel from previous exhibitions. Time stagnates, while still going through ups and downs, just like the silent “still life” releasing a huge tension. The squeezed space, seemingly small, but is in fact gravitational. A beam of light foreshadows the vastness outside the “space capsule”, where “force” has gained its weight and tangible form. Via the de-formalized approach, Ma Yansong challenges the “Forma Fantasia”.\n\nMany moments or ancient rituals in history, in the ever-changing time and space, will always be presented with sacred meanings. “Forma Fantasia” here implies an eternal law, the light and shadow, the dynamic and trend in the long river of history and in all the triviality of the past. The dynamic and static, openness and intensity, verticality and falling, flying and sinking in these illustrated objects may originate from still life in the Cubist or Futuristic paintings, which may indicate the breakage of branches and trees in spring,  a midnight torrential rain in the 19th century, a stone tablet lost in a space odyssey, or the magnificent ripples deriving from tens of thousands of years in just a blink of eyes.\n\nIn the poster created by Designer Guang Yu, the form itself conveys such an imagination, where all information is arranged in a tower. The line represents the horizon and the circle hangs high like a moon rising over the ancient tower erecting against the sky. “Forma Fantasia” is also the fantasy of the “Nine-Tiered Pagoda”. It hopes that people can get out of the shackles and imagine a future without boundaries with broad perception. We fantasize and fight in the spring of hope and the winter of despair, until everything goes silent.\n\nCurator: Cui Cancan",author:"Liu Wei",cover_imageurl:["exhibitions-9-1","exhibitions-9-2","exhibitions-9-3","exhibitions-9-4","exhibitions-9-5","exhibitions-9-6"],time:"2021.5.9—2021.12.5",content:"As the sixth project of “Nine-Tiered Pagoda”, “Forma Fantasia” is like a rhapsody, a laboratory of forms that inspires imagination, or a stage play that breeds infinite power.

Via the de-formalized approach, Ma Yansong challenges the “Forma Fantasia”.\n\nMany moments or ancient rituals in history, in the ever-changing time and space, will always be presented with sacred meanings. “Forma Fantasia” here implies an eternal law, the light and shadow, the dynamic and trend in the long river of history and in all the triviality of the past. The dynamic and static, openness and intensity, verticality and falling, flying and sinking in these illustrated objects may originate from still life in the Cubist or Futuristic paintings, which may indicate the breakage of branches and trees in spring,  a midnight torrential rain in the 19th century, a stone tablet lost in a space odyssey, or the magnificent ripples deriving from tens of thousands of years in just a blink of eyes.\n\nIn the poster created by Designer Guang Yu, the form itself conveys such an imagination, where all information is arranged in a tower. The line represents the horizon and the circle hangs high like a moon rising over the ancient tower erecting against the sky. “Forma Fantasia” is also the fantasy of the “Nine-Tiered Pagoda”. It hopes that people can get out of the shackles and imagine a future without boundaries with broad perception. We fantasize and fight in the spring of hope and the winter of despair, until everything goes silent.\n\nCurator: Cui Cancan",english_version:!0,planner_des:{curator:"Cui Cancan",curator_name:"Cui Cancan",exhibition_series:"Nine-Tiered Pagoda: Spatial and Visual Magic",exhibition_series_title:"Nine-Tiered Pagoda: Spatial and Visual Magic ⑥ Forma Fantasia - Solo Exibition of Liu Wei",QR_code:""}}},{article_id:"10",zh:{title:"“九层塔：空间与视觉的魔术”⑤“相似的结果，不同的路径”陈文骥+丁乙+梁铨+谭平",subtitle:"",series_title:"九层塔：空间与视觉的魔术",introduction:"作为九层塔的第五个项目，“相似的结果，不同的路径”是第一个群展，也是对抽象艺术创作方法的讨论，它关注艺术、建筑、设计中基础而又核心的议题：点、线、面在作品中的不断变化。展览以艺术家陈文骥、丁乙、谭平、梁铨的作品为基础，邀请建筑师张永和进行空间的呈现，平面设计师韩家英进行海报等视觉系统的创作。\n\n“相似的结果”指艺术家共同使用点、线、面，作为创作的全部元素，最后呈现出相似的画面形式；“不同的路径”指四位艺术家运用了截然不同的工作方式、观念意图、生产机制和创作语法。\n\n陈文骥用工业化的色彩和模块，以不同的组合和拼接方式，给出相异的节奏和停顿，形成一组排列有序的抽象作品。丁乙的5张作品从1993年开始，他将“十字”以各种媒介、材质、笔触、色彩、结构，进行“重复” 创作，产生了无限的变量。梁铨有自己的法则，他制作不同颜色的纸片，在画面中进行拼接，纸片多样的分布形成了永不重复的点线面关系。谭平的“位置系列”，则设计了一个规则：在画面上随机画上几个点，拉出放射线，然后在多次相交的放射线中确定几个交叉点，最终得出点在画面中的位置。我们会发现，四位艺术家的作品中，形式只是执行的手段，“路径”自身会发展作品，会产生变量。变量近乎无限。\n\n“相似的结果，不同的路径”为我们提供了重新认知抽象艺术的视角：它不再以形式创新为目的，而呈现了艺术家的观念思考、创作语法和系统性工作的重要性。\n\n建筑师张永和将这些“视角”转化为空间感受，为作品搭建了一个全新的场域。展览空间成为另一种形式的“点、线、面”的建造，观者有了不同的观看体验：大与小、内与外、上与下、动与静、看与被看。于是，建筑与绘画互动，观者与展览互动。设计师韩家英则提供了另一种交汇，艺术家的名字和作品元素的交汇，让简单的元素具有了现实感和个人性。\n\n“相似的结果，不同的路径”展现的是艺术家、建筑师和设计师共同的工作——对于点、线、面在秩序世界的无限探索。这些探索取决于情感和观念的变化，也取决于我们在各个领域中不断创造的工具、手法、路径。无数种方向和抵达，丰富了我们的语言世界。也因为点线面的本质、基础，所以永恒存在，近乎不朽。\n\n策展人：崔灿灿",author:"陈文骥、丁乙、谭平、梁铨",cover_imageurl:["exhibitions-10-1","exhibitions-10-2","exhibitions-10-3","exhibitions-10-4","exhibitions-10-5","exhibitions-10-6"],time:"2021.5.9—2021.12.5",content:"作为九层塔的第五个项目，“相似的结果，不同的路径”是第一个群展，也是对抽象艺术创作方法的讨论，它关注艺术、建筑、设计中基础而又核心的议题：点、线、面在作品中的不断变化。展览以艺术家陈文骥、丁乙、谭平、梁铨的作品为基础，邀请建筑师张永和进行空间的呈现，平面设计师韩家英进行海报等视觉系统的创作。\n\n“相似的结果”指艺术家共同使用点、线、面，作为创作的全部元素，最后呈现出相似的画面形式；“不同的路径”指四位艺术家运用了截然不同的工作方式、观念意图、生产机制和创作语法。\n\n陈文骥用工业化的色彩和模块，以不同的组合和拼接方式，给出相异的节奏和停顿，形成一组排列有序的抽象作品。丁乙的5张作品从1993年开始，他将“十字”以各种媒介、材质、笔触、色彩、结构，进行“重复” 创作，产生了无限的变量。梁铨有自己的法则，他制作不同颜色的纸片，在画面中进行拼接，纸片多样的分布形成了永不重复的点线面关系。谭平的“位置系列”，则设计了一个规则：在画面上随机画上几个点，拉出放射线，然后在多次相交的放射线中确定几个交叉点，最终得出点在画面中的位置。我们会发现，四位艺术家的作品中，形式只是执行的手段，“路径”自身会发展作品，会产生变量。变量近乎无限。\n\n“相似的结果，不同的路径”为我们提供了重新认知抽象艺术的视角：它不再以形式创新为目的，而呈现了艺术家的观念思考、创作语法和系统性工作的重要性。\n\n建筑师张永和将这些“视角”转化为空间感受，为作品搭建了一个全新的场域。展览空间成为另一种形式的“点、线、面”的建造，观者有了不同的观看体验：大与小、内与外、上与下、动与静、看与被看。于是，建筑与绘画互动，观者与展览互动。设计师韩家英则提供了另一种交汇，艺术家的名字和作品元素的交汇，让简单的元素具有了现实感和个人性。\n\n“相似的结果，不同的路径”展现的是艺术家、建筑师和设计师共同的工作——对于点、线、面在秩序世界的无限探索。这些探索取决于情感和观念的变化，也取决于我们在各个领域中不断创造的工具、手法、路径。无数种方向和抵达，丰富了我们的语言世界。也因为点线面的本质、基础，所以永恒存在，近乎不朽。\n\n策展人：崔灿灿",english_version:!0,planner_des:{curator:"崔灿灿",curator_name:"崔灿灿",exhibition_series:"九层塔：空间与视觉的魔术",exhibition_series_title:"“九层塔：空间与视觉的魔术”⑤“相似的结果，不同的路径”陈文骥+丁乙+梁铨+谭平",QR_code:""}},en:{title:"Nine-Tiered Pagoda: Spatial and Visual Magic ⑤ Similar Results, Different Approaches - Chen Wenji + Ding Yi + Liang Quan + Tan Ping",subtitle:"",series_title:"Nine-Tiered Pagoda: Spatial and Visual Magic",introduction:"As the fifth project of “Nine-Tiered Pagoda”, “Similar Results, Different Approaches” is the first group exhibition unveiling a discussion on abstract art creation methods, with the focus on elementary and core issues in art, architecture, and design: the constant change of dots, lines and planes in the work.
