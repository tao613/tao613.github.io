<p>For two weeks, nearly 15 groups of artists/groups are stationed in Pingshan to create live artworks, inviting the public to interact with the arts. The theme, &ldquo;Chirp - Art Camping&rdquo; for exchanges and communication, is inspired by the lifestyle of young people in the south, such as camping, music and film festivals in a warm climate.</p>

    <p>Pingshan Art Museum&rsquo;s deputy director Li Yao, has taken art out of the museum&rsquo;s architectural box and brought it into public and outdoor spaces. In conjunction with the rise of second-generation artists, the Public Art Season has commissioned a number of young artists/compositions that are active in or directly connected to the Pearl River Delta.</p>
<p>According to LI Yao, &ldquo;I wish for the lifestyle of camping to be linked with the practice of contemporary art, making interpretation in the public space with the connotations of artistic practice in linking with others' presence, participation, transcendence, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Using the outdoor terrace on the 5th floor of the PAM, the Ping Shan Cultural Complex and the Central Park as a temporary camp, the artists will engage in wandering, camping, dialogue and creation, presenting cross-media artworks involving objects, sound, video, play, language and body.</p>
<p>Featuring works by:
<strong>Shenzhen Ting｜Mountain River Jump! ｜ZHU Xiang｜See You Tomorrow｜Jiu Society｜LIU Xiaoqing｜YE Su｜Lu Wei HD Channel｜LI Liao｜CUI Yingting｜Wen Jie Jun Jie</strong></p>
