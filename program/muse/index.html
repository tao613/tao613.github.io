<p>In 2019, the Pingshan Art Museum presented the annual exhibition Synchronicity, from the curator&rsquo;s beautiful vision of spending time together in harmony to the New Year, the current situation unexpectedly gives rise to another meaning of &ldquo;synchronicity&rdquo; - &ldquo;spending difficult times together&rdquo;. The epidemic has changed a lot and the future trajectory remains unclear. What should we and our museums do in the midst of this? Art may seem feeble at the moment, but its true power lies in the process of recording, experiencing and reflecting on things that give us a wake-up call, thus giving us hope for the future.</p>
<p>Toward the end of first half of the year at the Pingshan Art Museum, we present the exhibition Muse, Yu Gong and Compasses, curated by Lu Mingjun. Narrated with historical memory, the exhibition contrasts with today’s globalization and modernity, and surprisingly, alongside their tremendous power of retraction. The curator, Lu Mingjun, invites ten artists/groups to participate in a journey of historical site investigation and contemporary myths writing. Thirty-two works of painting, video and installation will be on view until August 30, 2020.</p>

    <p>In the 2010 film of Mnemosyne, African British artist John Akomfrah composes a &ldquo;sad song&rdquo; about migration and travel, memory and mourning, knowledge and identity, nature and politics, following the poetics path laid out by Dante, Beckett, Emily Dickinson, James Joyce, Milton, Nietzsche, Shakespeare, Sophocles, and Dylan Thomas, etc. Coincidentally, Singaporean artist Ho Tzu Nyen epitomizes a similar grief in his gripping epic, The Cloud of Unknowing. Inspired by A Theory of Cloud: Toward a History of Painting  written by art historian Hubert Damisch, Ho takes classic artworks of Caravaggio, Zurbarán, Correggio, Bernini, Mantegna, René Magritte and others as the blueprint, depicting the protagonist in each section as clouds, boundless and flexible, yet interwoven with love and hatred, good and evil, as well as other absurd, bizarre and compelling emotions and experiences.</p>
<p>Ten years later, the Exhibition of Muses, Yu Gong and Compasses will continue the epic along their imaginative and narrative paths. From John Akomfrah&rsquo;s Mnemosyne and Ho Tzu Nyen’s The Cloud of Unknowing, to Gong Jian&rsquo;s Muse, and Fang Di&rsquo;s Minister, from Yang Fudong&rsquo;s Moving Mountains, Chu Bingchao&rsquo;s The Hill of Qifu, to Zheng Guogu&rsquo;s Planting Geese, Duan Jianyu&rsquo;s Horse, from Rachel Rose&rsquo;s Wil-o-Wisp to Birdhead&rsquo;s Passions Bloom Ambitions and Phototheism, here presents an epic story composed by Muses, Yu Gong and Compasses and a profound fable born out of myths, legends and magic.</p>
<p>A century ago, the rise of monopoly capitalism and imperialism messed with people’s head and triggered two world wars. While a century later, the crisis of capitalism and the global pandemic have once again forced humanity into an age of frenzy where myths, legends and magic thrive. We all remember Karl Marx&rsquo;s famous quote from The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, &ldquo;Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.&rdquo; It’s still hard for us to say the situation today is a farce yet, but we are pretty sure those crazy phantoms from a hundred years ago are back with us.</p>
