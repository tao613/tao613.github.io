<p>In 2019, the Pingshan Art Museum presented the annual exhibition Synchronicity, from the curator&rsquo;s beautiful vision of spending time together in harmony to the New Year, the current situation unexpectedly gives rise to another meaning of &ldquo;synchronicity&rdquo; - &ldquo;spending difficult times together&rdquo;. The epidemic has changed a lot and the future trajectory remains unclear. What should we and our museums do in the midst of this? Art may seem feeble at the moment, but its true power lies in the process of recording, experiencing and reflecting on things that give us a wake-up call, thus giving us hope for the future.</p>
<p>Toward the end of first half of the year at the Pingshan Art Museum, we present the exhibition Muse, Yu Gong and Compasses, curated by Lu Mingjun. Narrated with historical memory, the exhibition contrasts with today’s globalization and modernity, and surprisingly, alongside their tremendous power of retraction. The curator, Lu Mingjun, invites ten artists/groups to participate in a journey of historical site investigation and contemporary myths writing. Thirty-two works of painting, video and installation will be on view until August 30, 2020.</p>

    <p>In the 2010 film of Mnemosyne, African British artist John Akomfrah composes a &ldquo;sad song&rdquo; about migration and travel, memory and mourning, knowledge and identity, nature and politics, following the poetics path laid out by Dante, Beckett, Emily Dickinson, James Joyce, Milton, Nietzsche, Shakespeare, Sophocles, and Dylan Thomas, etc. Coincidentally, Singaporean artist Ho Tzu Nyen epitomizes a similar grief in his gripping epic, The Cloud of Unknowing. Inspired by A Theory of Cloud: Toward a History of Painting  written by art historian Hubert Damisch, Ho takes classic artworks of Caravaggio, Zurbarán, Correggio, Bernini, Mantegna, René Magritte and others as the blueprint, depicting the protagonist in each section as clouds, boundless and flexible, yet interwoven with love and hatred, good and evil, as well as other absurd, bizarre and compelling emotions and experiences.</p>
<p>Ten years later, the Exhibition of Muses, Yu Gong and Compasses will continue the epic along their imaginative and narrative paths. From John Akomfrah&rsquo;s Mnemosyne and Ho Tzu Nyen’s The Cloud of Unknowing, to Gong Jian&rsquo;s Muse, and Fang Di&rsquo;s Minister, from Yang Fudong&rsquo;s Moving Mountains, Chu Bingchao&rsquo;s The Hill of Qifu, to Zheng Guogu&rsquo;s Planting Geese, Duan Jianyu&rsquo;s Horse, from Rachel Rose&rsquo;s Wil-o-Wisp to Birdhead&rsquo;s Passions Bloom Ambitions and Phototheism, here presents an epic story composed by Muses, Yu Gong and Compasses and a profound fable born out of myths, legends and magic.</p>
<p>A century ago, the rise of monopoly capitalism and imperialism messed with people’s head and triggered two world wars. While a century later, the crisis of capitalism and the global pandemic have once again forced humanity into an age of frenzy where myths, legends and magic thrive. We all remember Karl Marx&rsquo;s famous quote from The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, &ldquo;Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.&rdquo; It’s still hard for us to say the situation today is a farce yet, but we are pretty sure those crazy phantoms from a hundred years ago are back with us.</p>

    <p>The year 2020 will be different than ever because of the coronavirus that spread across the world. We have seen the suffering and pain brought by the pandemic, and we have also experienced the will and strength to unite against it! LU Xun wrote in &ldquo;This Is Life Too&rdquo;: &ldquo;Distances away, countless people, all related to me.&rdquo; The persistence of the retrograde and ordinary people who emerged from this disaster is the best illustration of this statement.</p>
<p>On March 30, 2020, the PAM celebrates its first anniversary. On this memorable occasion, the Museum compiles the efforts and achievements of the past year, and launch a series of events such as &ldquo;Anniversary Chronicle&rdquo;, &ldquo;A Message to the Art Museum&rdquo;, online lectures on contemporary art, virtual museum, Chinese contemporary art yearbook and other special events, covering the wonderful beginning of the PAM and a future full of possibilities. When the sun rises as usual, life slowly returns, PAM will be with you all, to spread the value of contemporary art and explore the new frontier of aesthetics practices.</p>

<p>Coined synchronicity by the Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961), contemplations on meaningful coincidences and timelessness are reflected upon at Synchronicity, the first contemporary art exhibition of Pingshan Art Museum (PAM). The structure of the exhibition echoes the title presented in a parallel relationship. Curator LI Zhenhua described the exhibition as &ldquo;seven personal stories in flashback&rdquo;, which connects the creative logic of the seven artists in their own language, geography and intellectual experience of time. In the late 1980s, for example, Roman Signer was introduced to the art academies in China via publications and videos, and was widely studied.</p>

    <p>In 2011, with the support of Documenta Kassel, Helmhaus, the Swiss Cultural Foundation, and the New Times Media Art Center, Roman Signa&rsquo;s works have been on a series of touring exhibitions in China, the first of which was held at the China Academy of Fine Arts Art Museum and co-curated by Qiu Zhijie and LI Zhenhua. In the course of the project, XU Wenkai, HU Jieming, LÜ Shengzhong, QIU Zhijie, Wang Jianwei and other artists were linked by two lectures in Shanghai and Beijing in 2011, and behind the seemingly coincidental meetings, the artists are constantly tracing their own temporal clues, asking for the driving force of their creative change and exploring their own ways of connecting with the outside world.</p>
<p>This exhibition at PAM is considered by LI Zhenhua as &ldquo;a wrap-up of the project&rdquo;. He specifically invited this group of artists who share the same moment to exhibit, selected works by each artist created during a particular period of transition or under a particular historical event. The exhibition seeks to extend discussion of new realities and issues in the progress of contemporary art history, between the commonalities and identities that intersect with each other.</p>

    <p>Pingshan Art Museum&rsquo;s deputy director Li Yao, has taken art out of the museum&rsquo;s architectural box and brought it into public and outdoor spaces. In conjunction with the rise of second-generation artists, the Public Art Season has commissioned a number of young artists/compositions that are active in or directly connected to the Pearl River Delta.</p>
<p>According to LI Yao, &ldquo;I wish for the lifestyle of camping to be linked with the practice of contemporary art, making interpretation in the public space with the connotations of artistic practice in linking with others' presence, participation, transcendence, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Using the outdoor terrace on the 5th floor of the PAM, the Ping Shan Cultural Complex and the Central Park as a temporary camp, the artists will engage in wandering, camping, dialogue and creation, presenting cross-media artworks involving objects, sound, video, play, language and body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unknown City: Installation and Imagery on Chinese Contemporary Architecture&rdquo; is the first exhibition at Pingshan Art Museum (PAM), joined by numerous practitioners related to the field of architecture in China&rsquo;s 40 years of rapid urbanization. During the time, the architects designed the city themselves, but were also &ldquo;bewildered&rdquo; by the city, as the urban space became ever uncertain and complex. This paradoxical cycle of material creation and cultural disintegration undoubtedly has deep philosophical connotations. Whether in urban culture or the study of architecture, in contemporary art or philosophy, the &ldquo;unknown city&rdquo; is a proposition worthy of in-depth study.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Unknown City&rdquo; is symbolizes a nebulous definition of cities of the past, present and future, as well as an imaginary space with no limits. The certainty of the city is in danger of being shattered by future architects. So what is the real &ldquo;city itself&rdquo; in our minds? The answers to this question may be very different. The discussion revolving the questions through special forms of expression, such as space installations and imagery, is the main goal of this exhibition.</p>
