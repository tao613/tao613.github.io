<p>The sum of all recognizable human behaviors, materials and non-materials might be the concept mentioned by Daniel in his narrative of materialization. It is not restricted to the conversion of thinking and concept by material but about accumulation which is both unstable and uncertain. He intentionally separates this form of art from sculptures, paintings or installations. Rather than defining his creations and works within Dadaism, conceptual art, art of intertextuality or relational aesthetics, he thinks more about constantly-changing forms in integrated temporal clues and issues in super-fast society, as well as potential consequences of openness.</p>
<p>Powder created in 1994 implies characteristics of relational aesthetics. Performing elements are involved such as exhibits (cocaine) confiscated by the police station and policemen on duty; patterns in powder, primitive impulses and protection with bullet-proof glass; real scene and secondary media coverage. His habits are similar to streaming media today as their focuses and works are constantly adapting and transforming themselves. With spectators and researchers feeling perplexed like engulfed by heavy fog, it is hard to have a focus when carriers of the work keep changing themselves. </p>

<p>Originality of the work concept is also shifting, ceaselessly generating different intersections on a timeline. The only thing that could be traced reversely is time. Between the past and future, there are dots of condensation that form consistency in movement studied in photography or configurations of passes in games. Besides, if overlapped media are peeled away, there are factors of graphics in design media, confiscate spoils, reaction of real spectators, and social service providers in police station and exhibition room.</p>

<p>As the ninth and also the last project of Nine-Tiered Pagoda, “Forum & Review” brings the conclusion and retrospection for the whole exhibition over the past year.</p>
<p>The exhibition is divided into three parts. Starting from works designed by six artists, namely Cai Lei, Liu Gangshun, Nabuqi, Sui Jianguo, Yang Bodu, Zhang Xiaogang, Part One, with architect Liu Xiaodu creating the space, and graphic designer Huang Yang in charge of posters and other visual designs, echoes the subtitle of the exhibition, “Spatial and Visual Magic”, via different media and discourse systems.</p>
<p>Part Two is the recall of the whole exhibition with all nine “tiers” being presented simultaneously. The nine sets of extraordinary works with nine kinds of “space” and “design” constitute, and are also converged into, a real “Nine-Tiered Pagoda”. Our sincere appreciation goes to all participating artists for their endeavor in the first 8 solo exhibitions. They are: Artist Jiang Jie, Peng Wei, Yin Xiuzhen, Xie Nanxing, Liu Wei, Chen Wenji, Ding Yi, Liang Quan, Tan Ping, Li Binyuan, Mao Yan, Han Dong, Li Qing, PSFO (Hong Hao, Xiao Yu, Song Dong, Liu Jianhua, Leng Lin); Architect Xu Tiantian, He Jianxiang, Ma Yansong, Chang Yongho, Wu Linshou, Wang Hui, Li Han, Wang Zigeng; Graphic designer Xiao Mage, Ma Shirui, Guang Yu, Han Jiaying, Jumping He, Zhu Sha, Mei Shuzhi, Liu Zhizhi.</p>

<p>At the top tier of the Pagoda, also the last part of the exhibition, we’ll hold six forums in a space resembling an exhibition hall, a conference room, a theater or even a temple. In the first forum, we will have artists carrying out discussions as practitioners; In the second one, we will invite professional media from art, architecture, design for more transboundary exchanges; Dozens of architects outside this exhibition will attend the third and fourth forum; In the fifth one, we will meet more graphic designers while exhibition curator, art institutions and critics will gather in the last forum. All participants from different disciplines will have marathon-like dialogue in the two months, aiming to expand the boundary in our mind via extensive topics.</p>

<p>作为新一代文化代表的中坚力量，刘韡、马岩松、广煜的工作，植根于中国发展进程中的一个重要阶段，深受新世纪中国社会特有的变动和起伏影响——城市和人文景观的快速变迁。在这个时期，现代主义中的形式不再作为形式而存在，形式成了快速变幻与未来想象的媒介。“狂想”召唤人们走向形式的指引，走向无限的联想和“所有”。这里的“所有”可能是万事万物的运动法则，这里的“明暗光影”可能是时间的起源或变幻的光阴，“上扬的线条”可能预示着飞升的雄心，“圆”是起点，也是循环的终点。</p>
<p>和九层塔其它项目相比，这个展览有了新的合作方式，艺术家刘韡并没提供“完整”的作品，而是提供了一些作品的材料和散落的部件。这些几何形体的圆、块面、曲线，带着打磨的痕迹，像是立体主义绘画的笔触，或是等待被摆放的抽象形体，最终以什么形式展出，由建筑师决定。</p>

<p>“相似的结果”指艺术家共同使用点、线、面，作为创作的全部元素，最后呈现出相似的画面形式；“不同的路径”指四位艺术家运用了截然不同的工作方式、观念意图、生产机制和创作语法。</p>
<p>陈文骥用工业化的色彩和模块，以不同的组合和拼接方式，给出相异的节奏和停顿，形成一组排列有序的抽象作品。丁乙的5张作品从1993年开始，他将“十字”以各种媒介、材质、笔触、色彩、结构，进行“重复” 创作，产生了无限的变量。梁铨有自己的法则，他制作不同颜色的纸片，在画面中进行拼接，纸片多样的分布形成了永不重复的点线面关系。谭平的“位置系列”，则设计了一个规则：在画面上随机画上几个点，拉出放射线，然后在多次相交的放射线中确定几个交叉点，最终得出点在画面中的位置。我们会发现，四位艺术家的作品中，形式只是执行的手段，“路径”自身会发展作品，会产生变量。变量近乎无限。</p>

<p>“Perspectival Playground” is different from traditional solo exhibitions of architects as it does not display models, drawings and renderings as usual. Instead, it presents another clue offered by Architect Yung Ho Chang. Through the space design and installations, the playground of “perspective” and “seeing” is thereby established.</p>
<p>As the most important architect in China, Yung Ho Chang has not only designed many eye-catching architectural works, but also participated in a large number of art exhibitions and theoretical studies with a complex system of his own, covering from the changes in Asian urbanization to the experimentation of exhibition construction. The driving force for the development of this system lies in the architect's broad vision and diversified exploration. He constantly returns to the starting point of architecture, reflecting on and reconstructing all basic elements, thus opening up the possibility to re-understand architecture.</p>
<p>The five installations in the exhibition of “Looking for” are presenting a brief history of perspective. The work begins with the experiment regarding linear perspective carried out in the 14th century by Italian Architect Filippo Brunelleschi who pioneered the era of constructing spaces with scientific methods. It is the beginning of the entire exhibition and also a metaphor for Yung Ho Chang’s working routines. Here, he has paved a way for us to look for “perspective”.</p>
</blockquote>
  <button class="moreBtn">+ Read More</button>
  <div class="collapsible">
<p>Down the journey led by Yung Ho Chang, we can look for the one-point perspective created by the Architect Andrea Palladio in the 16th century and the complicated experience of abstract urban spaces in current days; we can take a guess about the camera obscura used by Vermeer when he painted in the 17th century; we can learn from the Painter Kazimir Malevich in the early 20th century to create 6 rotatable viewfinders; we can also find the perspective relationship between windows, rooms, and furniture in the movie “Rear Window” produced by Alfred Hitchcock, and create a brand new “Window” thereof.</p>
<p>Pieces in “Looking for” have formed a space game pointing to the history of the architecture itself with the imagination of the possibility for perspective. In the game, the time and space created by architects and artists from different eras have never been interrupted. They're mixed together, with no distinction between ancient and modern, the past and the present.</p>
<p>In other words, “Looking for” has intercepted a static experience through precise construction, designing multiple channels for “seeing”, which makes originally abstract motion clear and concrete. We complete the process of discovery by “seeing”, which, in turn, is merged with here.</p>
<p>But these five works are different from traditional architecture as they are creating a  pure spatial game and experiment. “Looking for” brings us back to the root of architecture by removing the practicality and theme, returning to the core elements that form the theme. That being said, these “installations” are not models, nor are they tools and paths for the construction. They exist independently, with their own order, destination and meaning.</p>
<p>However, these installations are not entirely “art” either, for they are rationally designed rather than merely imagined. They're derived from the pursuit for knowledge starting from perspective studies in the Enlightenment. Everything about perspective needs to be recorded, so the means of description must be accurate. They are not “painted” or “carved”, but calculated. It is the accurate means and tightly knitted creation and verification that endow these works with purposes, functions and meanings completely different from artistic creations (perspective in installations, sculptures, paintings).</p>
<p>Yung Ho Chang travels through movies, paintings, and architectures of various eras, looking for a space experience that can stand out from traditional perspectives, and seeking ways to design time through space. How should time be spent and where should it travel through? “Looking for” has become the intermediate zone between architecture and art, inspiring people to think about space, self, and existence in a different way during the exploration of the space consciousness in the human world.</p>

<p>Shenzhen Contemporary Artists Series No.1Xue Feng: Far Far</p>
<p>Some views have been coming to Xue Feng’s mind all the time, such as a flat boat sailing through the West Lake, the infinite distance looking from the open doors. The flat boat or the open doors may exist in reality or they may tell many bygone memories. However, they cannot be equated with that in Xue Feng’s mind. Knowing that the views as he envisioned are always untouchable, he transcribed the views in the far and deep distances on a flat picture. What he has been depicting is the distance instead of the views.</p>
<p>By means of painting, Xue Feng measures the distance between himself and the images in his mind. The process of painting can be as long as it takes to “adjust the focus”. Since he strives to inch towards images in his mind, his paintings are always subject to intertwined and fuzzy changes. With images in the painting degrading to a few colors, a few brushstrokes and several layers, Xue Feng draws the distance in line with the varying density and intensity. Sometimes, even the “mental images” will deviate from the “real images”, only showcasing the abstract depths. The brushstrokes are condensed into a glued shelter, rendering a deep and remote distance. As a result, he will not illustrate what is in the distance or what is in his mind.</p>

<p>Nine-Tiered Pagoda: Spatial and Visual Magic, as a cross-disciplinary event, represents an unprecedented direction and form of exhibition in China.  Nine (groups of) artists will provide their works as the basis material for the exhibition. Besides, nine architects and nine designers will also join to form nine temporary teams, hence the cooperation among artists, architects and designers. There is no ‘priority’ or ‘center’ in the exhibition, only division of labor and collaboration, presenting nine individual exhibitions of a brand-new type.</p>
<p>As the core determinant for the exhibition, space and design are also a kind of re-creation of the exhibition and the work; They determine the content and way the audience see the exhibition, as well as the sequence and pace. Space and design, no longer in the service of the exhibition, provide an independent and autonomous experience for the audience, granting the exhibition a myriad of variables and possibilities.</p>

<p>In 2019, the Pingshan Art Museum presented the annual exhibition Synchronicity, from the curator&rsquo;s beautiful vision of spending time together in harmony to the New Year, the current situation unexpectedly gives rise to another meaning of &ldquo;synchronicity&rdquo; - &ldquo;spending difficult times together&rdquo;. The epidemic has changed a lot and the future trajectory remains unclear. What should we and our museums do in the midst of this? Art may seem feeble at the moment, but its true power lies in the process of recording, experiencing and reflecting on things that give us a wake-up call, thus giving us hope for the future.</p>
<p>Toward the end of first half of the year at the Pingshan Art Museum, we present the exhibition Muse, Yu Gong and Compasses, curated by Lu Mingjun. Narrated with historical memory, the exhibition contrasts with today’s globalization and modernity, and surprisingly, alongside their tremendous power of retraction. The curator, Lu Mingjun, invites ten artists/groups to participate in a journey of historical site investigation and contemporary myths writing. Thirty-two works of painting, video and installation will be on view until August 30, 2020.</p>

    <p>In the 2010 film of Mnemosyne, African British artist John Akomfrah composes a &ldquo;sad song&rdquo; about migration and travel, memory and mourning, knowledge and identity, nature and politics, following the poetics path laid out by Dante, Beckett, Emily Dickinson, James Joyce, Milton, Nietzsche, Shakespeare, Sophocles, and Dylan Thomas, etc. Coincidentally, Singaporean artist Ho Tzu Nyen epitomizes a similar grief in his gripping epic, The Cloud of Unknowing. Inspired by A Theory of Cloud: Toward a History of Painting  written by art historian Hubert Damisch, Ho takes classic artworks of Caravaggio, Zurbarán, Correggio, Bernini, Mantegna, René Magritte and others as the blueprint, depicting the protagonist in each section as clouds, boundless and flexible, yet interwoven with love and hatred, good and evil, as well as other absurd, bizarre and compelling emotions and experiences.</p>
<p>Ten years later, the Exhibition of Muses, Yu Gong and Compasses will continue the epic along their imaginative and narrative paths. From John Akomfrah&rsquo;s Mnemosyne and Ho Tzu Nyen’s The Cloud of Unknowing, to Gong Jian&rsquo;s Muse, and Fang Di&rsquo;s Minister, from Yang Fudong&rsquo;s Moving Mountains, Chu Bingchao&rsquo;s The Hill of Qifu, to Zheng Guogu&rsquo;s Planting Geese, Duan Jianyu&rsquo;s Horse, from Rachel Rose&rsquo;s Wil-o-Wisp to Birdhead&rsquo;s Passions Bloom Ambitions and Phototheism, here presents an epic story composed by Muses, Yu Gong and Compasses and a profound fable born out of myths, legends and magic.</p>
<p>A century ago, the rise of monopoly capitalism and imperialism messed with people’s head and triggered two world wars. While a century later, the crisis of capitalism and the global pandemic have once again forced humanity into an age of frenzy where myths, legends and magic thrive. We all remember Karl Marx&rsquo;s famous quote from The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, &ldquo;Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.&rdquo; It’s still hard for us to say the situation today is a farce yet, but we are pretty sure those crazy phantoms from a hundred years ago are back with us.</p>

    <p>The year 2020 will be different than ever because of the coronavirus that spread across the world. We have seen the suffering and pain brought by the pandemic, and we have also experienced the will and strength to unite against it! LU Xun wrote in &ldquo;This Is Life Too&rdquo;: &ldquo;Distances away, countless people, all related to me.&rdquo; The persistence of the retrograde and ordinary people who emerged from this disaster is the best illustration of this statement.</p>
<p>On March 30, 2020, the PAM celebrates its first anniversary. On this memorable occasion, the Museum compiles the efforts and achievements of the past year, and launch a series of events such as &ldquo;Anniversary Chronicle&rdquo;, &ldquo;A Message to the Art Museum&rdquo;, online lectures on contemporary art, virtual museum, Chinese contemporary art yearbook and other special events, covering the wonderful beginning of the PAM and a future full of possibilities. When the sun rises as usual, life slowly returns, PAM will be with you all, to spread the value of contemporary art and explore the new frontier of aesthetics practices.</p>

<p>Coined synchronicity by the Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961), contemplations on meaningful coincidences and timelessness are reflected upon at Synchronicity, the first contemporary art exhibition of Pingshan Art Museum (PAM). The structure of the exhibition echoes the title presented in a parallel relationship. Curator LI Zhenhua described the exhibition as &ldquo;seven personal stories in flashback&rdquo;, which connects the creative logic of the seven artists in their own language, geography and intellectual experience of time. In the late 1980s, for example, Roman Signer was introduced to the art academies in China via publications and videos, and was widely studied.</p>

    <p>In 2011, with the support of Documenta Kassel, Helmhaus, the Swiss Cultural Foundation, and the New Times Media Art Center, Roman Signa&rsquo;s works have been on a series of touring exhibitions in China, the first of which was held at the China Academy of Fine Arts Art Museum and co-curated by Qiu Zhijie and LI Zhenhua. In the course of the project, XU Wenkai, HU Jieming, LÜ Shengzhong, QIU Zhijie, Wang Jianwei and other artists were linked by two lectures in Shanghai and Beijing in 2011, and behind the seemingly coincidental meetings, the artists are constantly tracing their own temporal clues, asking for the driving force of their creative change and exploring their own ways of connecting with the outside world.</p>
<p>This exhibition at PAM is considered by LI Zhenhua as &ldquo;a wrap-up of the project&rdquo;. He specifically invited this group of artists who share the same moment to exhibit, selected works by each artist created during a particular period of transition or under a particular historical event. The exhibition seeks to extend discussion of new realities and issues in the progress of contemporary art history, between the commonalities and identities that intersect with each other.</p>

<p>According to LI Yao, &ldquo;I wish for the lifestyle of camping to be linked with the practice of contemporary art, making interpretation in the public space with the connotations of artistic practice in linking with others' presence, participation, transcendence, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Using the outdoor terrace on the 5th floor of the PAM, the Ping Shan Cultural Complex and the Central Park as a temporary camp, the artists will engage in wandering, camping, dialogue and creation, presenting cross-media artworks involving objects, sound, video, play, language and body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unknown City: Installation and Imagery on Chinese Contemporary Architecture&rdquo; is the first exhibition at Pingshan Art Museum (PAM), joined by numerous practitioners related to the field of architecture in China&rsquo;s 40 years of rapid urbanization. During the time, the architects designed the city themselves, but were also &ldquo;bewildered&rdquo; by the city, as the urban space became ever uncertain and complex. This paradoxical cycle of material creation and cultural disintegration undoubtedly has deep philosophical connotations. Whether in urban culture or the study of architecture, in contemporary art or philosophy, the &ldquo;unknown city&rdquo; is a proposition worthy of in-depth study.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Unknown City&rdquo; is symbolizes a nebulous definition of cities of the past, present and future, as well as an imaginary space with no limits. The certainty of the city is in danger of being shattered by future architects. So what is the real &ldquo;city itself&rdquo; in our minds? The answers to this question may be very different. The discussion revolving the questions through special forms of expression, such as space installations and imagery, is the main goal of this exhibition.</p>
