<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Unknown City: Installation and Imagery on Chinese Contemporary Architecture&rdquo; is the first exhibition at Pingshan Art Museum (PAM), joined by numerous practitioners related to the field of architecture in China&rsquo;s 40 years of rapid urbanization. During the time, the architects designed the city themselves, but were also &ldquo;bewildered&rdquo; by the city, as the urban space became ever uncertain and complex. This paradoxical cycle of material creation and cultural disintegration undoubtedly has deep philosophical connotations. Whether in urban culture or the study of architecture, in contemporary art or philosophy, the &ldquo;unknown city&rdquo; is a proposition worthy of in-depth study.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Unknown City&rdquo; is symbolizes a nebulous definition of cities of the past, present and future, as well as an imaginary space with no limits. The certainty of the city is in danger of being shattered by future architects. So what is the real &ldquo;city itself&rdquo; in our minds? The answers to this question may be very different. The discussion revolving the questions through special forms of expression, such as space installations and imagery, is the main goal of this exhibition.</p>
