<p>&ldquo;No one would have imagined that the Pingshan Art Museum would mark the first anniversary of its new establishment on this bleak March day. It&rsquo;s a moment to remember. Each person, each institution, is trying to adjust itself toward the summer of unknown and hope. We stand at this waypoint, looking back, looking forward. We record, contemplate, imagine and celebrate with art. Life goes on, art accompanies, and we appreciate the attention and help of friends in the past year. Together, we look forward to the year ahead, when Pingshan Art Museum will continue to present many more excitements and splendor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>LIU Xiaodu, Director, Pingshan Art Museum</p>

    <p>The year 2020 will be different than ever because of the coronavirus that spread across the world. We have seen the suffering and pain brought by the pandemic, and we have also experienced the will and strength to unite against it! LU Xun wrote in &ldquo;This Is Life Too&rdquo;: &ldquo;Distances away, countless people, all related to me.&rdquo; The persistence of the retrograde and ordinary people who emerged from this disaster is the best illustration of this statement.</p>
<p>On March 30, 2020, the PAM celebrates its first anniversary. On this memorable occasion, the Museum compiles the efforts and achievements of the past year, and launch a series of events such as &ldquo;Anniversary Chronicle&rdquo;, &ldquo;A Message to the Art Museum&rdquo;, online lectures on contemporary art, virtual museum, Chinese contemporary art yearbook and other special events, covering the wonderful beginning of the PAM and a future full of possibilities. When the sun rises as usual, life slowly returns, PAM will be with you all, to spread the value of contemporary art and explore the new frontier of aesthetics practices.</p>
