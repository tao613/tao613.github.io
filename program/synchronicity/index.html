<p>Coined synchronicity by the Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961), contemplations on meaningful coincidences and timelessness are reflected upon at Synchronicity, the first contemporary art exhibition of Pingshan Art Museum (PAM). The structure of the exhibition echoes the title presented in a parallel relationship. Curator LI Zhenhua described the exhibition as &ldquo;seven personal stories in flashback&rdquo;, which connects the creative logic of the seven artists in their own language, geography and intellectual experience of time. In the late 1980s, for example, Roman Signer was introduced to the art academies in China via publications and videos, and was widely studied.</p>

    <p>In 2011, with the support of Documenta Kassel, Helmhaus, the Swiss Cultural Foundation, and the New Times Media Art Center, Roman Signa&rsquo;s works have been on a series of touring exhibitions in China, the first of which was held at the China Academy of Fine Arts Art Museum and co-curated by Qiu Zhijie and LI Zhenhua. In the course of the project, XU Wenkai, HU Jieming, LÜ Shengzhong, QIU Zhijie, Wang Jianwei and other artists were linked by two lectures in Shanghai and Beijing in 2011, and behind the seemingly coincidental meetings, the artists are constantly tracing their own temporal clues, asking for the driving force of their creative change and exploring their own ways of connecting with the outside world.</p>
<p>This exhibition at PAM is considered by LI Zhenhua as &ldquo;a wrap-up of the project&rdquo;. He specifically invited this group of artists who share the same moment to exhibit, selected works by each artist created during a particular period of transition or under a particular historical event. The exhibition seeks to extend discussion of new realities and issues in the progress of contemporary art history, between the commonalities and identities that intersect with each other.</p>
