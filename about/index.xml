      <description>The Pingshan Art Museum (PAM) is situated in Shenzhen Pingshan Culture Quarter, with a total area of 9,900 square meters. With an open-ended approach for artistic exploration, PAM is concerned about the cross-boundaries integration and fission of a range of areas. That include technology, media, environment in the changing society of the times. By putting forward different forms and expressions in space, PAM preserves, collects and disseminates the vitality and vision of art.</description>

      <description>The architecture was commissioned in 2014 and designed by renowned Chinese architect DONG Gong. Part of the building&amp;rsquo;s ground floor is elevated, its design intersperses different functions within the edifice. This allows certain operations to remain as active urban spaces that draw people through even after the museum is closed. The design of PAM not only serves functionally as a temple of art, but also a space that provides serenity in the union of art, spirit and city.</description>
